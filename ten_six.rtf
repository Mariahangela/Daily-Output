	We are also on half day today because we need to get the grades we requested last time from school. Anyway, I didn't continue the project I'm making yesterday because it is really difficult in my level. So I watched several videos about how to change the icons of the app. I tried doing it once but it has so many errors, I can't complete it today, hoping to complete it all tomorrow}
